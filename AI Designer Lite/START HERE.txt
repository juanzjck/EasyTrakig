FUTURE UPDATES: I originally built this AI system for my development team for us to quickly iterate and share AI for multiple game projects.  It mostly served our needs. If you have specific feature requests, send it to me at aibotsystem@gmail.com or go to www.AIBotSystem.com.  If there's enough demand, I'll add it in!  Same for bugs and errors. This is beta with beta pricing)... Current buyers receive free updates, even when this product's price goes up.
